# DAZ Product Installer

This is an application currently only for Windows users to install their products regardless of the vendor's format; it accepts unique file structurs and archive extensions.


## What does this project aim to do?
Firstly, it aims to be a **free** and **open-source*** application to gain trust of users, allow others to contribute, and release a product that is useful for all.
Additonally, it - 
 - Make an application that is able to process any archive (ZIP, RAR, 7z).
 - Quickly install products regardless of file structures. **This is very useful for Renderosity and other vendor websites**.
 - Also be a library to store processed/installed products.
 - Be a database to search for products for users who have a lot of products.
 - [ In debate ] Be a product management for products that are from Renderosity and other vendors.


## Project Status
Alpha

Currently, the application can:
  - ✅ Recognize and intelligently install products regardless of file structure.
  - ✅ Handle any most file structures (ie: Content as root folder, or not).
  - ✅ Recursively install products in an archive; handles bundles.
  - ✅ Supports WIN-ZIP, RAR formats
  - ✅ Create extraction & product records.
  - ✅ Choose your preferences (ie: install locations, temp location, product handling, etc).
  - ✅ Hold records of installation files (database).
  - ✅ Search products you've downloaded.

The application cannot at this stage:
  - ❌ Handle 7z files.
  - ❌ Detect product IDs from DAZ consistently.
  - ❌ Fetch thubmnails consistently - error prone.
  - ❌ Merge "part" archives into a single record.
  - ❌ Manage content / delete or move on request.
  - ❌ Handle certain MANIFEST tasks such as "EXECUTE".
  - ❌ Consistently create tags based off of file names, content, etc (creates some tags but stops due to some error).
  - ❌ Handle password-protected archives appropriately (RAR, 7z).

  - `UsefulFuncs` - `DPCommon`, `ArrayHelper`, and `PathHelper` are in this file.
  - `DPTaskManager` - class for ensuring async tasks are sequential.
  - And more.

`src\External` - Executables and source code not created by me or this community
  - `RAR.cs` - dependency for `DPProcessor`.
  - `7za.exe` - will be dependency for 7z operations. 
  - `SQLRegexFunction` - will be removed.

`src\Forms` - Similar to Custom Controls but is a .NET Form; handles visual & user-event logic for new dialog/application windows.
  - Main Form - `MainForm.cs` - The main form of this application.
  - Password Input Dialog - `PasswordInput.cs` - Special dialog for password-protected archives. 
  - Product Record Form - `ProductRecordForm.cs` - Form for displaying the record in the database (and later editing).
  - Database View - `DatabaseView.cs` - Form for displaying all contents in the database.
`src\Libs` - Currently only consists of rar.dll - used for handling RAR files.

`ImportFileRecordsToDatabase` - small program to transfer file system records to the database. Though, this is really only for me.

## How to get started?

This project requires you use **Visual Studio 2022.** Currently, we are using **.NET 6**, please make sure you have .NET 6 installed. _You might be able to use an older version like Visual Studio 2019, please let me know._

To open this project with Visual Studio, please select the solution file, located at `src\DAZ_Installer.sln`. All of the settings should be identical to mine, there may be some issues if you use Mac or Linux.
